                    career  in  unhelpful  ways  �  Ms  Sexton  explained  how  she  heard  the  Claimant  talking  about
                    Ms  Heard�s  career  and  was  disparaging  her  choices  (14/2250/11-22].  The  Claimant  was

                  <div class="timeline-body">Moreover  the  evidence  adduced  by  the  Claimant  that  Ms  Heard  had  such  relationships
                    was  very  thin.  Mr  Romero  said  that  Ms  Heard  was  visited  regularly  at  the  Eastern
                    by  Mr  Musk  (statement  paragraph  7);  however  Mr  Romero�s
                    Columbia  Building
                    recollection  of  dates  was  extremely  faulty  �  see  below.  As  he  said  in  cross-examination  �/
                    cannot  remember  exactly  the  year,  because  it  has  been  for  a  couple  of  years  already�
                    [9/1398/2-3]  and  �I  get,  like  you  said,  the  years  messed  up�  (9/1398/19-20].  On  Mr
                    Romero�s  account,  he  saw  Mr  Musk�s  regular  visits  start  in  March  2015,  a  year  before  Ms
                    Heard  even  moved  into  the  building.  Mr  Baruch  confirmed  he  only  saw  Mr  Musk  in  the
                    Eastern  Columbia  Building  after  21  May  2016  [9/1384/4-7].  Ms  Esparza�s  evidence  on  Mr
                    Musk  related  to  the  period  after  the  break  up.  She  made  a  reference  to  Ms  Heard  having
                    marks  on  her  after  what  was  said  to  be  a  visit  from  Mr  Musk  in  June/July  2016;  but  she
                    was  now  unable  to  recall  where  on  Ms  Heard�s  body  the  alleged  injuries  were  [5/891/9-
                    13].  This  evidence  was  gratuitous  and  plainly  adduced  by  the  Claimant  in  an  improper
                    attempt  publicly  to  smear  Mr  Musk  �  reflecting  his  determination  to  seek  vengeance
                    against  Mr  Musk,  another  of  the  Claimant�s  objectives,  as  he  explained  that  he  had  in  his
                    text  to  Mr  Carino  in  August  2016  [File  6/119/F687.194]. </div>

                    was  very  thin.  Mr  Romero  said  that  Ms  Heard  was  visited  regularly  at  the  Eastern
                    by  Mr  Musk  (statement  paragraph  7);  however  Mr  Romero�s
                    Columbia  Building
                    recollection  of  dates  was  extremely  faulty  �  see  below.  As  he  said  in  cross-examination  �/
                    cannot  remember  exactly  the  year,  because  it  has  been  for  a  couple  of  years  already�
                    [9/1398/2-3]  and  �I  get,  like  you  said,  the  years  messed  up�  (9/1398/19-20].  On  Mr
                    Romero�s  account,  he  saw  Mr  Musk�s  regular  visits  start  in  March  2015,  a  year  before  Ms
                    Heard  even  moved  into  the  building.  Mr  Baruch  confirmed  he  only  saw  Mr  Musk  in  the
                    Eastern  Columbia  Building  after  21  May  2016  [9/1384/4-7].  Ms  Esparza�s  evidence  on  Mr
                    Musk  related  to  the  period  after  the  break  up.  She  made  a  reference  to  Ms  Heard  having
                    marks  on  her  after  what  was  said  to  be  a  visit  from  Mr  Musk  in  June/July  2016;  but  she
                    was  now  unable  to  recall  where  on  Ms  Heard�s  body  the  alleged  injuries  were  [5/891/9-
                    13].  This  evidence  was  gratuitous  and  plainly  adduced  by  the  Claimant  in  an  improper
                    attempt  publicly  to  smear  Mr  Musk  �  reflecting  his  determination  to  seek  vengeance
                    against  Mr  Musk,  another  of  the  Claimant�s  objectives,  as  he  explained  that  he  had  in  his
                    text  to  Mr  Carino  in  August  2016  [File  6/119/F687.194]. </div>

                    explanation  for  the  San  Francisco  meeting  was  credible:  she  had  been  in  a  relationship
                    with  him  and  married  to  him  only  very  recently  [10/1639/12-14].  Both  she  and  the

                    was  very  thin.  Mr  Romero  said  that  Ms  Heard  was  visited  regularly  at  the  Eastern
                    by  Mr  Musk  (statement  paragraph  7);  however  Mr  Romero�s
                    Columbia  Building
                    recollection  of  dates  was  extremely  faulty  �  see  below.  As  he  said  in  cross-examination  �/
                    cannot  remember  exactly  the  year,  because  it  has  been  for  a  couple  of  years  already�
                    [9/1398/2-3]  and  �I  get,  like  you  said,  the  years  messed  up�  (9/1398/19-20].  On  Mr
                    Romero�s  account,  he  saw  Mr  Musk�s  regular  visits  start  in  March  2015,  a  year  before  Ms
                    Heard  even  moved  into  the  building.  Mr  Baruch  confirmed  he  only  saw  Mr  Musk  in  the
                    Eastern  Columbia  Building  after  21  May  2016  [9/1384/4-7].  Ms  Esparza�s  evidence  on  Mr
                    Musk  related  to  the  period  after  the  break  up.  She  made  a  reference  to  Ms  Heard  having
                    marks  on  her  after  what  was  said  to  be  a  visit  from  Mr  Musk  in  June/July  2016;  but  she
                    was  now  unable  to  recall  where  on  Ms  Heard�s  body  the  alleged  injuries  were  [5/891/9-
                    13].  This  evidence  was  gratuitous  and  plainly  adduced  by  the  Claimant  in  an  improper
                    attempt  publicly  to  smear  Mr  Musk  �  reflecting  his  determination  to  seek  vengeance
                    against  Mr  Musk,  another  of  the  Claimant�s  objectives,  as  he  explained  that  he  had  in  his
                    text  to  Mr  Carino  in  August  2016  [File  6/119/F687.194]. </div>

                    prescribed  drug,  Provigil,  for  narcolepsy,  although  the  Claimant�s  doctor,  Dr  Kipper,  put

                    client,  and  he  was  the  priority  [12/2015/8  �  2016/19].  As  the  Claimant  himself  explained

                    San  Francisco  on  22  July  2016  had  she  genuinely  been  afraid  of  him.  However  her
                    explanation  for  the  San  Francisco  meeting  was  credible:  she  had  been  in  a  relationship
                    with  him  and  married  to  him  only  very  recently  [10/1639/12-14].  Both  she  and  the
                    Claimant  wanted  to  meet  in  the  presence  of  Mr  Carino  [13/2103/19-24].  Ms  Heard  also
                    confirmed  that  she  had  sought  to  communicate  with  the  Claimant  on  24  May  2016  by
                    phone  to  discuss  keeping  the  divorce  under  wraps  for  at  least  a  few  days  �in  the  hardest
                    times  of  my  life�.  She  said,  convincingly,  that  this  in  no  way  meant  she  was  not  scared  of
                    him  [11/1732/10-24,  1733  13-14]. </div>

                  <div class="timeline-body">Moreover  the  evidence  adduced  by  the  Claimant  that  Ms  Heard  had  such  relationships
                    was  very  thin.  Mr  Romero  said  that  Ms  Heard  was  visited  regularly  at  the  Eastern
                    by  Mr  Musk  (statement  paragraph  7);  however  Mr  Romero�s
                    Columbia  Building
                    recollection  of  dates  was  extremely  faulty  �  see  below.  As  he  said  in  cross-examination  �/
                    cannot  remember  exactly  the  year,  because  it  has  been  for  a  couple  of  years  already�
                    [9/1398/2-3]  and  �I  get,  like  you  said,  the  years  messed  up�  (9/1398/19-20].  On  Mr
                    Romero�s  account,  he  saw  Mr  Musk�s  regular  visits  start  in  March  2015,  a  year  before  Ms
                    Heard  even  moved  into  the  building.  Mr  Baruch  confirmed  he  only  saw  Mr  Musk  in  the
                    Eastern  Columbia  Building  after  21  May  2016  [9/1384/4-7].  Ms  Esparza�s  evidence  on  Mr
                    Musk  related  to  the  period  after  the  break  up.  She  made  a  reference  to  Ms  Heard  having
                    marks  on  her  after  what  was  said  to  be  a  visit  from  Mr  Musk  in  June/July  2016;  but  she
                    was  now  unable  to  recall  where  on  Ms  Heard�s  body  the  alleged  injuries  were  [5/891/9-
                    13].  This  evidence  was  gratuitous  and  plainly  adduced  by  the  Claimant  in  an  improper
                    attempt  publicly  to  smear  Mr  Musk  �  reflecting  his  determination  to  seek  vengeance
                    against  Mr  Musk,  another  of  the  Claimant�s  objectives,  as  he  explained  that  he  had  in  his
                    text  to  Mr  Carino  in  August  2016  [File  6/119/F687.194]. </div>

                    on  file  and  photographed/on  camera  at  the  Eastern  Columbia  building,  that  she  was
                    conspiring  with  Ms  Heard�s  group  and  that  he  would  subpoena  her  for  a  deposition  if  she
                    did  not  speak  to  him  and  sign  a  declaration  in  support  of  his  client.  He  said  that  the

                    would  be  subpoenaing  other  people  in  Ms  Heard�s  group  for  perjury.  She  told  Ms  Heard
                    that  as  a  result  she  was  left  shaken  for  days  and  had  not  slept  for  a  number  of  nights. </div>

                  <div class="timeline-body">Photograph  of  Amber  Heard  and  Ian  McLagan.  On  5  July  2020  the  Claimant  disclosed  this  to
                    the  Defendants  with  a  metadata  date/time  of  �April  7,  2013  1  1:02PM�  [9/86(e)(i)/348.16]  but
                    on  21  July  2020  Ms  Laws  QC  put  to  Ms  Heard  in  cross-examination  that  this  photograph  was
                    in  fact  taken  on  23  March  2020.  This  assertion  was  made  on  the  basis  of  the  travel  documents
                    of  Jan  McLagan  [11/  Tabs  148  and  149]:  see  Transcript,  Day  11,  pages  1810�18  17.
                    Ms  Heard�s  evidence  was  that  �I  do  not  know  when  it  [this  photograph]  was  taken  �  but  her
                    bottom  lip  in  this  photograph  looked  swollen  to  her  (Day  11,  pages  1810,  lines  10-17  and
                    pages  1817-18).
                    Ms  Henriquez�  evidence  was  that  in  this  photograph  �J  see  makeup  and  a  split  lip.�  (Day  13,
                    page  2156,  lines  19-20). </div>

                    informed  me  that  her  husband  Johnny  would  be  coming  over
                    shortly  to  pick  up  a  few  of his  personal  effects  &  discuss  their
                    current  situation.  At  8:06PM  I  received  a  text from  Amber  asking
                    me  to  come  over  to  PH3  right  away.  At  8:09PM  I  texted  back  to
                    confirm  she  needed  me  immediately.  At  8:11  PM  I  knocked  on  the
                    door.  The  door  was  locked  so  I  went  back,  grabbed  my  keys,
                    knocked  again,  heard  Johnny  yelling.  I  immediately  unlocked  the
                    door  and  came  in  to  see  him  standing  in  the  kitchen  area.  I  asked
                    if everything  was  ok,  to  which  Amber  replied  "No.  Help  me."
                    Johnny  had  a  magnum  of wine  in  his  hand,  and  told  me  to  leave.  I
                    looked  at  Amber  holding  her face  &  her  head,  and  she  then  told
                    me  that  he  threw  her  phone  at  her  and  hit  her,  and  to  please  help
                    her.  He  proceeded  to  argue,  deny  any  and  all  wrongdoing,  all
                    while  continuing  to  move  closer  to  Amber.  I  stepped  in  front  of
                    him  to  shield  her from  him  and  put  my  hands  on  his  chest,  telling </div>

                    exactly  what  he  was  saying  ,  but  it  was  a  reputation  something
                    along  the  lines  of:  "Get  the fuck  out  of my  house,"  "You
                    motherfuckers fucking  sold  me  out,"  so  on  and  so  forth  .  The

                    way  to  the  door.  I  had forgotten  my  keys,  so  I  turned  around  to
                    grab  them.  He followed  me  every  step  of the  way  throughout,
                    screaming  and  spitting  in  my face.  I  did  not  see  where  Liz  went  to,
                    as  I  thought  she  was  right  behind  me.  He  made  a  beeline  to  go
                    right  at  her,  and  she  ran  away.  After  I  had  left,
                    screaming  and  smashing  things  inside  the  apartment  as  I  made  my
                    way  over  to  PH3  to  check  on  Raquel  &  Amber,  during  which  they
                    I  moved  them  over  to  our  apartment
                    relayed  what  had  occurred  .
                    PHI  ,  and  dead-bolted  the  door  until  we  were  certain  he  had  left.
                    I  kept  them  inside  PH1  ,  and  went  down  to  the  garage  to  confirm
                    their  departure.  At  8:46PM,  I  started  getting  calls  from  his  head
                    of security,  Jerry,  as  Johnny  had  left  his  �phone  there,  and  Jerry
                    wanted  me  to  bring  it  down  for  him  to  pick  up.  I  told  him  not  to
                    pull  into  the  complex,  and  that  I  would  meet  him  at  the front  door.
                    We  had  a  verbal  confrontation  in  the  process  of handing  off the

                    no  more  than  a foot  away from  us,  with  me  still  cradling  her.  At
                    this  point  his  security,  Jerry  &  Sean  came  in.  As  soon  as  they
                    come  in,  he  retreated  away,  about  15 feet.  Amber  got  up  to  head
                    towards  the  bathroom,  telling  Jerry  that  if he  "hits  me  one  more
                    time  I'm  calling  the  cops."  Johnny  denied  that  he  had  struck  her.
                    He  said  that  he  had  "thrown  her  phone  at  her,  and  that's
                    what  she's  accusing  me  of."  Amber  then  repeated  what  she  had
                    said  before  "I  didn't  do  anything,  if he  hits  me  one  more  time  I'm
                    calling  the  cops."  He  then  went  into  the  kitchen  area  and  started
                    smashing  things  at  random.  His  security  did  nothing  but  stand
                    behind  him.  No  effort  was  made  to  restrain  him,  no
                    acknowledgment  was  made  of the  abuse,  nor  did  they  make  any
                    verbal  effort  to  try  and  diffuse  the  situation  or  get  him  to  walk
                    away.  He  then  stormed  out  of the  apartment,  screaming
                    unintelligibly.  That  was  the  last  I  saw  of him  that  evening.  I  heard
                    him  yelling  and  breaking  things for  the  next  I �5-30  minutes  in  the
                    hallway  and  other  apartments.  When  I  went  to  find  Amber's  phone
                    and  purse  in  PH3  and  PHS,  still  not  knowing  if he  was  on  the
                    premises,  I  discovered  broken  belongings.  This  included  my  art
                    that  had  been  thrown  against  the  wall,  Amber's  office  that  had
                    been  ransacked,  framed photos  that  had  been  smashed  and  glass
                    broken,  and  art  that  had  been  taken  from  the  wall  and  left  on  the
                    bed  in  Amber's  room  .  In  the  public  hallway  there  were  puddles  of
                    spilled  wine  on  the floor  and  splashed  on  the  walls,  and  dents  in
                    the  doors.  Amber  was  in  my  apartment  (PHI)  when  the  police
                    arrived.  To  my  knowledge  he  had  already  vacated  the  premises.
                    I  declare  under  penalty  of perjury  that  the  foregoing  is  true  and
                    correct,  Executed  on  Sunday,  May  22. </div>
