                    10 You were asked questions about May
                    11          22nd.

                    12      A.  Yes.

                    13      Q.  Let me ask you this.  You explained to Ms. Wass, when she
                    14          asked you whether you had ever seen Ms. Heard leave the
                    15          building without makeup, you thought for a little while and
                    16          you said, yes, you had seen her.  Do you remember that?

                    17      A.  Yes.

                    18      Q.  On that day, on 22nd May, did you see Ms. Heard leave the
                    19          building as soon as you spoke to her?

                    20      A.  Oh, no.  She was, this was -- no, I left.  I left the scene.

                    21      Q.  Do you know whether Ms. Heard, if she put on makeup, put on
                    22          makeup in the car or anywhere else that day?

                    23      A.  No, I would have no clue.

                    P.1388

                    4      Q.  You say in your witness statement, just summarising, that you
                    5          saw her up close on May 22nd, you saw her up close again on
                    6          May 23rd, you saw her up close also on May 24th, and you saw
                    7          her up close again on either the 25th, you think, or even
                    8          maybe the 26th, but you are not entirely sure; is that
                    9          correct?

                    10      A.  Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.  Sunday, the first
                    11          interaction.  Monday, her knocking on my door for me to take
                    12          the key, to see if I would take the key to let Hilda in to
                    13          clean the apartment.  That is Monday.  Tuesday, twice, her </div>

                    20      A.  That is correct.

                    21      Q.  How certain are you about that?

                    22      A.  100%.

                    23      Q.  Now, you had known Ms. Heard for some time by May 2016, had
                    24          you not?

                    25      A.  Since March 2016, I mean 2013.

                    P.1372

                    2      Q.  2013.  They moved in in March 2013, so you had known her three
                    3          years and two months; yes?

                    4      A.  Is that how long that is?

                    5      Q.  13 ----

                    6      A.  From March 2013, from March 2013 is when I first met her, in
                    7          March 2013.

                    8      Q.  I understand.  Have you ever known her to go out to a party
                    9          without makeup on?

                    10      A.  I would not know that.

                    20      MS. WASS:  Yes.  Mr. Baruch, I asked you, having known Ms. Heard
                    21          for three years and a bit, whether you had ever known her go
                    22          to a party or to an outside event without being made up;
                    23          I think you said you could not say that.

                    24      THE WITNESS:  Yes, I would not know that.  I do not know how many
                    25          parties she went to.  I do not know, you know, if every time

                    P.1373

                    2          she went to a party.  So, I could not tell you.

                    But when
                    12          you have known that she has been going to a party, have you
                    13          ever seen her without makeup?

                    14      A.  Any time that I saw her go to an event, that she was decked
                    15          out in, she had makeup on.

                    16      MS. WASS:  Had you ever known her leave the apartment block and go
                    17          to a public place without wearing makeup?

                    18      A.  (Pause) I do not know.  Yes.  Yes.

                    13      A.  No, sir.  The tattoo was altered in about 1993.

                    14      Q.  1993?

                    15      A.  Yes.

                    19      A.  Yes, that is correct.

                    2      MS. LAWS:  I think there is an e-mail exchange which I can go to
                    3          which indicates that Keith Richards was looking forward to
                    4          seeing you.  That was on 20th March.  Is this you in the
                    5          photograph with Mr. Richards?

                    6      A.  Yes, it is.

                    7      MR. JUSTICE NICOL:  Just a minute.  (Pause) Which one are you,
                    8          please?

                    9      A.  I am in between Johnny and Keith.  That is my sister next to
                    10          Keith.

                    11      MR. JUSTICE NICOL:  Yes.

                    12      MS. LAWS:  Do you agree that there is absolutely no injury on your
                    13          face in this photograph?

                    14      A.  I cannot tell in this photograph.

                    15      Q.  When do you say the incident took place?  Are you sticking
                    16          with 23rd March?

                    17      MR. JUSTICE NICOL:  22nd March.

                    18      MS. LAWS:  22nd March, sorry.  Are you sticking with that date,
                    19          22nd March?

                    20      A.  For the painting incident or the one that we called disco

                    24      A.  The painting incident took place on the 22nd.

                    12          that after the arguments, there was an episode of filming on
                    13          that date?

                    9          involved filming a documentary with Keith Richards?

                    8          painting done by Tasya van Ree which was on your bedroom wall.

                    9          Do you remember that part of the evidence?

                    10      A.  I remember him saying that.

                    11      Q.  Was it one of those two paintings that we see in those two
                    12          documents in the trial bundle?

                    13      A.  Well, he defaced both and was upset about ----

                    14      MR. JUSTICE NICOL:  No no.  The question was whether you were able
                    15          to say whether the painting that Mr. Depp asked you to remove
                    16          was one of these two paintings.

                    17      A.  Well, he did ask me to remove both of them, the one we have
                    18          been talking about the burning is the one that is part of the
                    19          text message screen grab between Mr. Hop, Johnny, and my
                    20          sister.

                    3          years and two months; yes?

                    4      A.  Is that how long that is?

                    5      Q.  13 ----

                    6      A.  From March 2013, from March 2013 is when I first met her, in
                    7          March 2013.

                    8      Q.  I understand.  Have you ever known her to go out to a party
                    9          without makeup on?

                    10      A.  I would not know that.

                    20      MS. WASS:  Yes.  Mr. Baruch, I asked you, having known Ms. Heard
                    21          for three years and a bit, whether you had ever known her go
                    22          to a party or to an outside event without being made up;
                    23          I think you said you could not say that.

                    24      THE WITNESS:  Yes, I would not know that.  I do not know how many
                    25          parties she went to.  I do not know, you know, if every time

                    P.1373

                    2          she went to a party.  So, I could not tell you.

                    But when
                    12          you have known that she has been going to a party, have you
                    13          ever seen her without makeup?

                    14      A.  Any time that I saw her go to an event, that she was decked
                    15          out in, she had makeup on.

                    16      MS. WASS:  Had you ever known her leave the apartment block and go
                    17          to a public place without wearing makeup?

                    18      A.  (Pause) I do not know.  Yes.  Yes.

                    2      Q.  2013.  They moved in in March 2013, so you had known her three
                    3          years and two months; yes?

                    4      A.  Is that how long that is?

                    5      Q.  13 ----

                    6      A.  From March 2013, from March 2013 is when I first met her, in
                    7          March 2013.

                    8      Q.  I understand.  Have you ever known her to go out to a party
                    9          without makeup on?

                    10      A.  I would not know that.

                    20      MS. WASS:  Yes.  Mr. Baruch, I asked you, having known Ms. Heard
                    21          for three years and a bit, whether you had ever known her go
                    22          to a party or to an outside event without being made up;
                    23          I think you said you could not say that.

                    24      THE WITNESS:  Yes, I would not know that.  I do not know how many
                    25          parties she went to.  I do not know, you know, if every time

                    P.1373

                    2          she went to a party.  So, I could not tell you.

                    But when
                    12          you have known that she has been going to a party, have you
                    13          ever seen her without makeup?

                    14      A.  Any time that I saw her go to an event, that she was decked
                    15          out in, she had makeup on.

                    16      MS. WASS:  Had you ever known her leave the apartment block and go
                    17          to a public place without wearing makeup?

                    18      A.  (Pause) I do not know.  Yes.  Yes.

                    20      A.  That is correct.

                    22      A.  100%.

                    23      Q.  Now, you had known Ms. Heard for some time by May 2016, had
                    24          you not?

                    4          to your right, literally facing your face there or was it
                    5          behind you?

                    6      THE WITNESS:  I cannot quite recall exactly where the wall -- if
                    7          that was the doorway, I was closer to the doorway, or if I was
                    8          facing towards the wall, but I was facing towards the living
                    9          room.

                    10      Q.  What did the blood spatter look like?  You say you do not know
                    11          how it happened, but what did it look like?  I am sure that
                    12          was memorable.

                    13      A.  To be honest, we made light of it.  It was remarkable because
                    14          of the, of what had happened, but I was quick to make light of
                    15          it.  I know that sounds hard to imagine, but I was so ready to
                    16          believe that it would never happen again that we were quick to
                    17          make light of it.

                    18      Q.  There was no blood on the wall, which is why you cannot
                    19          describe it in any way, is it not?

                    20      A.  That is not true.


                    Ms Heard�s account evolved further when she was shown a photograph of herself with Ian
                    McLagan taken on 23 March 2013, but once again Ms Heard sought to cover herself by
                    giving evidence that she might be able to see an injury on a photograph where she clearly
                    had none.

                    P.1809
                    23      A.  I do not know his name.

                    24      Q.  You do not know his name.  He is, and he is ----

                    25      MR. JUSTICE NICOL:  Ian McLagan.

                    P.1810
                    2      MS. LAWS:  He is the guitarist for Keith Richards.

                    3      THE WITNESS:  Oh yes, I am vaguely familiar with this.

                    4      Q.  You are familiar with this photograph.  It shows you with a
                    5          clear face, does it not?

                    6      A.  What do you mean?

                    7      Q.  No injury?

                    8      A.  No, I cannot see an injury to my face.

                    9      Q.  No injury at all on that?

                    10      A.  I cannot really tell if my lip is bruised.

                    Ms James saw Ms Heard in the immediate aftermath of the plane journey in May 2014

                    P.1224

                    23      Q.  Do you remember contacting Ms. Heard after she had returned on
                    24          a plane journey from Boston, having travelled from New York,
                    25          where she was filming The Adderall Diaries with James Franco?

                    P.1225

                    2      A.  I believe she contacted me first, ma'am.

                    3      Q.  She contacted you.  What she says here ----

                    4      A.  Yes.

                    5      Q.  ---- in the text, and I will read it, is:  "I have to leave
                    6          JD.  He's just freaked out on me.  He is drinking again.  It's
                    7          bad, worse than ever.  I need out. ...(reads to the words)...
                    8          Please, Stephen will help arrange".  Then, the next text
                    9          reads: "Also, can you please see if you can redirect all of
                    10          his texts to me to Whitney's phone, or just block him
                    11          entirely.  I need to make this move".  Having seen those
                    12          texts, are you reminded about -- (Pause) Are you reminded
                    13          about what the subject-matter was?

                    14      A.  Yes, I remember the day very clearly, trust me.

                    15      Q.  Ms. Heard went to stay in a hotel?

                    16      A.  I do not know why because she had an apartment, but yes.

                    17      Q.  She had an apartment that she was sharing with Mr. Depp in the
                    18          Eastern Columbia Building?

                    19      A.  No, excuse me, ma'am, she had her own apartment that was still
                    20          being paid for and maintained by Mr. Depp, which was on Orange
                    21          Avenue.  You may have heard of that apartment before.

                    22      Q.  We have heard of that apartment.  I suggest ----

                    23      A.  That apartment was still fully functioning and liveable, so I
                    24          do not know why she went to The Chateau.

                    25      Q.  She did go to The Chateau, as you call it, the hotel?

                    P.1226

                    2      A.  Yes, she went to The Chateau with four of her friends and they
                    3          basically had a pool party all day.

                    4      Q.  She had friends who were supporting her in a traumatic event?

                    9          specifically.  I could not say specifically.

                    10      Q.  We are on our way to 80, that is 80 Sweetzer Avenue, is that

                    18      Q.  Or do you think, having seen what he said he had drunk and
                    19          imbibed by way of controlled drugs, he might have just
                    20          overdone it, and that is what made him ill?

                    21      A.  It is possible, yes.

                    22      Q.  That is possible as well?

                    23      MR. JUSTICE NICOL:  Just a minute.  (Pause) By "overdone it", do
                    24          you mean that he was drunk?

                    25      A.  The behaviour was not the behaviour of a drunkard, but

                    P.778

                    2          nevertheless, the consumption, as you said, because of the
                    3          consumption, it could be, you know, quite impressive, if you
                    4          will, and it could be a cause of that, yes.  So, not
                    5          necessarily behavioural but physical, yes.

                    Mr Deuters rejected the description set out in Ms Heard�s email to herself which he was taken
                    to

                    P.778
                    16      Q.  This is another e-mail from Ms. Heard to herself, but dated
                    17          25th May 2014 at 11.32 p.m; all right?

                    18      A.  Yes.

                    19      Q.  That is what the date is recorded as?

                    20      A.  Yes.

                    21      Q.  It reads as follows, and I am going to ask you about whether
                    22          you recognise the events that she is describing in case

                    18      MS. LAWS:  My Lord, moving on to the Tokyo incident, incident 7,
                    19          please, this is an allegation you make dated January 2015,
                    20          where you say Mr. Depp slapped you, grabbed your hair, and
                    21          yesterday we had a reference in your evidence that Mr. Depp,
                    22          you say, knelt on your back and was hitting you.  Is that all
                    23          true?

                    24      A.  Yes.

                    25      Q.  Did you attend a premier whilst in Tokyo?

                    P.1929

                    2      A.  Yes.

                    3      Q.  At what point did you attend that premier -- before or after
                    4          the assault?

                    5      A.  Two days after.  I remember being concerned about any visible
                    6          bruising on my back because my back was exposed.

                    7      MR. JUSTICE NICOL:  Just a minute.  (Pause)

                    8      MS. LAWS:  So the premier was two days after this assault?

                    9      A.  I believe somewhere around there.

                    10      Q.  Do you remember wearing a backless dress to that premier?

                    11      A.  Very well.  Very well.

                    17      Q.  That is in January 2015.  You explained that you were on a
                    18          trip to Tokyo and that you went not only with Ms. Heard, but
                    19          also with Lily-Rose, your daughter, and Jack?

                    20      A.  That is correct.

                    21      Q.  I think, to be fair, at that stage, I think Lily-Rose would
                    22          have been 15 or 16 and Jack 12 or 13?

                    23      A.  Somewhere around that.

                    24      Q.  Do not worry.  You said they were sleeping in an adjoining
                    25          room to yours and Ms. Heard's?

                    Page 682
                    2      A.  Yes.

                    3      Q.  How do you remember the time in the hotel with the children
                    4          and Ms. Heard?  Did you all interact together or were you very
                    5          separate?

                    6      A.  I was doing -- mostly, I was doing press, but when we were all
                    7          together ----

                    8      Q.  You were all together?

                    9      A.  We were all together and it was fine.

                    10      Q.  It was in that context that it was suggested to you -- and I
                    11          will not read out all the allegations again -- that you
                    12          shoved, wrestled her to the floor, grabbed her by the hair,
                    13          yelled at her, Ms. Heard said she was crying on the floor, and
                    14          this happened in hotel.  Where would the children have been
                    15          when you were in the hotel bedroom?

                    16      A.  They were either in our room or their room at all times.

                    17      Q.  If Lily-Rose or Jack had seen any marks or injuries on
                    18          Ms. Heard's face or body at the time, would they have asked
                    19          her about that, do you know?

                    20      A.  Certainly they would have. </div>

                    Ms Heard�s allegation that she was assaulted by Mr Depp in their hotel room in Tokyo when
                    they flew in for the premier of one of Mr Depp�s films lacks credibility. As Mr Depp explained
                    his two children had come on the trip with them. They had an adjourning room. That fact not
                    only undermines this specific allegation, but it also undermines the Defendants� more general
                    narrative that Mr Depp carried out his heinous assaults on Ms Heard when he so drunk or out

                    14          Ms. Heard that she did hit Mr. Depp in March 2015.  We have
                    15          your account of 21st April and the injuries you saw.  Are
                    16          those the only two incidents of injuries that Ms. Heard caused
                    17          to Mr. Depp that you know of?

                    18      A.  There was another incident in December in which he sustained
                    19          injuries from Ms. Heard -- Mr. Depp.

                    20      MR. JUSTICE NICOL:  Just a minute. (Pause) In December.  Can you
                    21          help me with which year?

                    22      A.  That would be 2015, sir.

                    23      MR. JUSTICE NICOL:  Thank you.

                    24      MR. SHERBORNE:  Can I ask you to take bundle 6.  It is the red
                    25          bundle to your right.

                    P.1306

                    14      MR. SHERBORNE:  There, we see there should be a photograph on
                    15          F894.092.

                    16      A.  Correct.

                    17      Q.  Do you see there a photograph of Mr. Depp?

                    18      A.  I do.

                    19      Q.  Can you just explain.  It says "Sean".  Can you just explain
                    20          what you know about this photo?

                    21      A.  I took this photo on December 15th, 2015.

                    22      Q.  Can I just pause for one second.  Just looking at the top, is
                    23          that IMG 2015, 12.15, a reference to the date you just gave
                    24          us?

                    25      A.  It is.

                    5          happened.  You have explained the mistake.  Can I ask you
                    6          about your evidence.  Now, in terms of what you saw on 21st
                    7          April, you said to Ms. Wass that you saw injuries that were
                    8          very similar to the ones in the photograph we now know is the
                    9          March photograph?

                    10      A.  Correct.

                    11      Q.  And Ms. Wass accepted, she said, that Ms. Heard had hit ----

                    12      MR. JUSTICE NICOL:  March 2015.

                    13      MR. SHERBORNE:  My Lord, yes.  Ms. Wass said it is accepted by
                    14          Ms. Heard that she did hit Mr. Depp in March 2015.  We have

                    The  cross-examination  of  Mr  Depp  focused  on  drugs,  but  not  violence.  It  also  focused  on
                    matters which are not probative of violence, for example Mr Depp�s disappointment with the
                    state of the film he was shooting and Mr Deuters� attempt to cheer him up. The dark language
                    used by Mr Depp in a text message to his friend, Paul Bettany, relied upon by the Defendants,
                    was nothing to the point.

                    The evidence of third parties, in particular Mr Ben King, is important. Mr King was frank about
                    the damage to the house, but his evidence also shows that Ms Heard�s more lurid account (in
                    her statement and then in cross-examination) cannot be believed. There was no urine from
                    Mr  Depp  �peeing  on  walls  and  carpet�,  no  dripping  blood,  raw  meat,  potatoes  and  gravy
                    smeared on a door. Further while he noticed diagonal cut marks on her arms, he saw no other
                    injuries.

                    He did not see or learn about a telephone smashed to the point of disappearing which featured
                    so graphically in Ms Heard�s account of how Mr Depp injured his finger.

                    Had  Ms  Heard  wanted  to  leave  the  house,  she  could  have  done  so,  whether  through
                    contacting security (who were hired by the production company), calling someone, or walking
                    out the glass doors of the bedroom.

                    Instead  she  was a  very active  participant  in the argument  on  8  March  2015.  The  evidence
                    supports the view that she was not just responsible for one broken bottle as she claimed, but
                    other damage too � including some of the writing on the bathroom mirror. While Mr Depp takes
                    responsibility for the damage which he caused, Ms Heard proved incapable of accepting that
                    she had done anything � on her account it was all one-way � but despite that she did not leave
                    at any point over the three days.

                    3      Q.  This is your way of trying to minimise the fact that this
                    4          whole incident was Amber attacking Mr. Depp, are you not?

                    5      A.  I disagree with that statement.  I am telling the truth.



                    Incident 10: S.E. Asia Train Journey

                    The evidence about the nature of the train, its staffing and the presence of a security person,
                    Malcolm Connolly, for Mr Depp and Ms Heard during their honeymoon completely
                    undermine Ms Heard�s account of an unprovoked attack in their cabin where she screamed
                    and/or Mr Depp was screaming at her. There is no evidence of any injury and Mr Connolly
                    did not see any injuries.

                    Day 5 (Re-examination of Mr Depp)

                    Page 698
                    10      MR. SHERBORNE:  Can I take you then to the next alleged incident,
                    11          Mr. Depp, incident 10 on the Southeast Asia train.  This was
                    12          part of your honeymoon; is that right?

                    13      THE WITNESS:  Yes.

                    14      Q.  It is July 2015.  Can I ask, was it just you and Ms. Heard who
                    15          were present on the train?

                    16      A.  We travelled with security, Malcolm Connolly, he was with us
                    17          for the entire honeymoon, for the trip.

                    18      Q.  You were not asked many questions about this by Ms. Wass, so
                    19          I am going to keep it very brief.  We know that Ms. Heard's
                    20          evidence is that you were very violent, according to her, you
                    21          hit her, you pushed her against the wall, you grasped her by
                    22          the throat and you caused her to fear for her very life; you
                    23          have seen that is what she says?

                    24      A.  Yes, I have seen it.

                    P.1937

                    25      Q.  It is Ms. Pennington's account: "I attended Thanksgiving

                    P.1938

                    2          Dinner with Johnny and Amber and a number of others at their
                    3          apartment PH5 in November 2015.  At one point, late in the
                    4          meal, Amber went upstairs to look for Johnny and stayed up
                    5          there for a long time.  After a long time, they both came

                    6          downstairs.  When I asked Amber what had happened, she told me
                    7          that Johnny had thrown a bottle of wine at her in the bedroom.
                    8          I went to look and found that a full bottle of wine had hit
                    9          and broken a piece of art that Amber really loves above the
                    10          bed and that broken glass was scatted all over the bed.  I
                    11          went back downstairs and spoke to Amber.  She was upset, but
                    12          just wanted to get through dinner without further problems."
                    13                Now, what she is saying is that this assault took place
                    14          while everyone was there, and that you had to go back
                    15          downstairs?

                    16      A.  No, she is saying ----

                    17      Q.  She is wrong?

                    18      A.  Excuse me?

                    19      Q.  Is she wrong?

                    20      A.  No.  She is saying this part of it took place while she was
                    21          there and others were downstairs.  She was just describing the
                    22          first part of the fight.

                    23      Q.  So the incident has two parts now, does it?

                    24      A.  Our fights typically involved many parts.

                    25      Q.  You are just making this all up as you go along to try and fit

                    P.1939

                    2          with evidence that comes out later, are you not?

                    3      A.  No.  I have had this information.

                    4      Q.  You see, this is a lying account, we say, from Raquel
                    5          Pennington, but we can deal with that with her.  She has got
                    6          one thing very wrong, has she not, in that, because what she
                    7          says is that in Penthouse 5, she has gone upstairs, asking you
                    8          what is happening, and you tell her that Johnny had thrown a </div>

                    23      Q.  These are Erin Burin's notes.  We can see that on 26th
                    24          November 2015 she has made an entry, making it clear that in
                    25          fact she joined in on Thanksgiving:  "RN visited client and

                    P.1943

                    2          husband/client JD's home in Downtown Los Angeles ...(reads to
                    3          the words)... client AH notified RN that she will need refills

                    5          So she was there on that day, was she not?

                    6      A.  Yes.  This reminds me.

                    7      Q.  She was there, was she, at the time before or after you had
                    8          been hit?

                    9      A.  The first interaction I had with Johnny, he just threw a
                    10          bottle at me, and ----

                    11      Q.  Sorry, I was asking about whether she was there or not?

                    12      A.  She was downstairs.

                    13      MR. JUSTICE NICOL:  I think you have established that Ms. Heard
                    14          agreed she was there.  But then you asked whether she was
                    15          there before or after the altercation.  Ms. Heard is giving
                    16          her answer.

                    17      THE WITNESS:  So, the violence, what I would call violence, at the
                    18          time, no.  She was there downstairs in penthouse 5 for the
                    19          bottle-throwing, the decanter breaking, the painting breaking.
                    20          I remember there was a slight altercation on the top of the
                    21          stairs involving wine and Johnny grabbing me by the short
                    22          collar ----

                    23      MS. LAWS:  Can I ask you, was she there ----

                    24      A.  ---- that was -- that is an altercation, so I was trying to
                    25          answer your question in full so you had the most information

                    P.1944

                    2          and I can answer you the best way possible.  There was a
                    3          slight altercation, but it was not what it later became after
                    4          everyone left; which she was not there for.

                    5      MS. LAWS:  Right.  I was not asking for another description ----

                    6      MR. JUSTICE NICOL:  Ms. Laws, you asked the question, Ms. Heard
                    7          has given her answer.  As I have understood the answer, is
                    8          that she was there for the interaction that you have described
                    9          involving a painting, but when you were asked whether
                    10          Ms. Burin was there when you were assaulted, I think you said
                    11          she was not. </div>

                    11          15th December 2015, again, this was an incident where you did
                    12          not witness anything happening, but you claim to have seen
                    13          injuries afterwards; is that correct?

                    14      A.  That is correct, and may I ask, is there a paragraph or file
                    15          that I should be looking at?

                    16      Q.  I will take you to it in a moment.  I am just establishing
                    17          your recollection of that.  What do you recollect as being the
                    18          injuries that you saw on Ms. Heard?

                    19      A.  On December 15th?

                    20      Q.  Yes.  What do you recollect?  I will take you to your
                    21          statement in a moment, but what do you recollect?

                    22      A.  The one that stands out the most in my memory is the injury to
                    23          the back of her head, the scalp, that was bloody, where hair
                    24          had been ripped out.

                  <div class="timeline-body">Incident 10: December 2015

                    The Court heard Mr Depp explain that generally he tried to avoid arguments with Ms Heard,
                    he would �run away from fights�. Ms Heard�s allegation that she was injured, escalated in her
                    evidence to asserting that Mr Depp had inflicted a broken nose on her. Having maintained,
                    falsely, that Mr Depp �head butted� her, she then made up an injury which would � had it
                    happened � have been consistent with a headbutt. But there was no broken nose. None of
                    the photographs support that (as Mr Depp noted one seemed to show a chapped lip) nor
                    does any third-party testimony support that or Ms Heard�s evidence (given on DAY 12) that
                    she �had two black eyes, a broken nose and a broken lip, bruised ribs, bruises all over my
                    body.� Ms Pennington�s description differed and no photographs show what she said she
                    saw, namely a swollen nose.

                    Ms Heard account of her injuries is contradicted by what Tara Roberts saw, or in fact did not
                    see, when Ms Heard went with Mr Depp to the Bahamas for Christmas and what Samantha
                    McMillen saw, in terms of lack of any injuries on 16 December 2015. There was no reason for
                    Ms McMillen to attend court in order to lie for Mr Depp. She was present when Ms Heard was
                    being made up and would have seen if she was sporting two black eyes (and a broken/ swollen
                    nose).  Similarly Kevin Murphy left Mr Depp�s employment some time ago. He has no vested
                    interest in lying for Mr Depp. He saw Ms Heard in her bedroom and took photos of a clump of
                    her hair on the carpet. But he was firm that the did not see any injuries to her face, although
                    she was upset.

                    Further,  Ms  Heard  could  not  explain  what  her  own  nurse,  Erin  Boerum,  noted  as  to  the
                    absence of any visible injury beyond a bleeding lip.

                    Page 491
                    14      Q.  Can I move forward, then, to December 2015.  Now, Mr. Depp, by
                    15          December 2015, you were routinely using violence against
                    16          Ms. Heard when you were intoxicated and when you were angry.
                    17          What do you say about that?

                    18      A.  I say that is incorrect, most of the time I tried to get away
                    19          from her.

                    20      Q.  During episodes when you would start by punching walls or
                    21          destroying property or shattering glass objects, that very
                    22          quickly escalated into a slap or pushing her over, or worse on
                    23          some occasions?

                    24      A.  No, that is incorrect.  Most of the time, Amber's, Ms. Heard's
                    25          problem was that I would run away from fights and I was then

                    19          from her.

                    20      Q.  During episodes when you would start by punching walls or
                    21          destroying property or shattering glass objects, that very
                    22          quickly escalated into a slap or pushing her over, or worse on
                    23          some occasions?

                    24      A.  No, that is incorrect.  Most of the time, Amber's, Ms. Heard's
                    25          problem was that I would run away from fights and I was then

                    2      Q.  Can you take file 2 out, please.  I am not going to take you
                    3          to a document just yet, but you have given an account in
                    4          evidence of an incident whereby Tara Roberts' partner had to,
                    5          in effect, take Mr. Depp away from you; is that what you were
                    6          saying?

                    7      A.  I believe my recollection is that towards the end of that
                    8          attack, Johnny only had me by the hair, and I was, there was a
                    9          bit of a scuffle trying to free myself from his grasp, and
                    10          they both approached us.  I think at the same time, and it is
                    11          my recollection that Tara leaned towards me and CJ, her
                    12          partner, leaned more towards Johnny and put his hands on
                    13          Johnny's chest or upper shoulders, and that, we had about two
                    14          feet of separation for a moment.

                    24      Q.  Can I ask you to go to page D229, please.  I am going to ask
                    25          you about what her account is.

                    P.1999

                    2      A.  All right.

                    3      Q.  Which she gave a statement to, and which was not challenged.
                    4          So let us have a look at paragraph 10:  "During the evening of
                    5          29th December 2015, Johnny drove to the office alone in his
                    6          John Deer Gator.  He had said he just needed to get away from
                    7          Amber.  Shortly afterwards, Amber showed up to the office.
                    8          Amber started pleading with him to come back to the house, and
                    9          at that point I walked out of the office.  A few minutes later
                    10          I heard his vehicle start and I stepped outside.  Amber was
                    11          standing in front of the vehicle, screaming at him and
                    12          apparently not letting him get away by blocking his path.
                    13          Then she climbed into the vehicle.  He drove her back to their
                    14          house.  I got in my golf cart and went to the caf�, which is a
                    15          short distance from the house.  I called Christi Dembrowski,
                    16          Johnny's sister, as I was unsure how far this would go.  While
                    17          I could not hear what caused the fight, Amber repeatedly
                    18          berated him with increasing ferocity.  She was insulting him,
                    19          calling him names, and in the middle of this onslaught I heard
                    20          her specifically say 'Your career is over, no one is going to </div>

                  <div class="timeline-body">Incident 10: December 2015

                    The Court heard Mr Depp explain that generally he tried to avoid arguments with Ms Heard,
                    he would �run away from fights�. Ms Heard�s allegation that she was injured, escalated in her
                    evidence to asserting that Mr Depp had inflicted a broken nose on her. Having maintained,
                    falsely, that Mr Depp �head butted� her, she then made up an injury which would � had it
                    happened � have been consistent with a headbutt. But there was no broken nose. None of
                    the photographs support that (as Mr Depp noted one seemed to show a chapped lip) nor
                    does any third-party testimony support that or Ms Heard�s evidence (given on DAY 12) that
                    she �had two black eyes, a broken nose and a broken lip, bruised ribs, bruises all over my
                    body.� Ms Pennington�s description differed and no photographs show what she said she
                    saw, namely a swollen nose.

                    Ms Heard account of her injuries is contradicted by what Tara Roberts saw, or in fact did not
                    see, when Ms Heard went with Mr Depp to the Bahamas for Christmas and what Samantha
                    McMillen saw, in terms of lack of any injuries on 16 December 2015. There was no reason for
                    Ms McMillen to attend court in order to lie for Mr Depp. She was present when Ms Heard was
                    being made up and would have seen if she was sporting two black eyes (and a broken/ swollen
                    nose).  Similarly Kevin Murphy left Mr Depp�s employment some time ago. He has no vested
                    interest in lying for Mr Depp. He saw Ms Heard in her bedroom and took photos of a clump of
                    her hair on the carpet. But he was firm that the did not see any injuries to her face, although
                    she was upset.

                    Further,  Ms  Heard  could  not  explain  what  her  own  nurse,  Erin  Boerum,  noted  as  to  the
                    absence of any visible injury beyond a bleeding lip.

                    14      Q.  Can I move forward, then, to December 2015.  Now, Mr. Depp, by
                    15          December 2015, you were routinely using violence against
                    16          Ms. Heard when you were intoxicated and when you were angry.
                    17          What do you say about that?

                    18      A.  I say that is incorrect, most of the time I tried to get away
                    19          from her.

                    21          destroying property or shattering glass objects, that very
                    22          quickly escalated into a slap or pushing her over, or worse on

                    15)

                    7                Now, that was over the phone, that conversation, but the
                    8          very next day, so on 17th December, Erin Burin is in contact

                    9          with you to notify you that she will be able to deliver your
                    10          medications to your home.  So she turned up -- this is quite
                    11          late -- at 11 o'clock at night, and waited at the door for
                    12          several minutes after knocking.  You greeted her at the door
                    13          looking dishevelled, with your hair unbrushed, weepy and sad,
                    14          slouched posture, and you told Ms. Burin about an argument
                    15          with Mr. Depp.  Then there is a discussion about her offering
                    16          emotional support and that she could not stay.  It is this bit
                    17          I am asking you about, the last sentence: "The client had

                    22          continued to bleed actively.  Client also states that her head
                    23          is bruised and she lost clumps of hair in altercation.  RN
                    24          briefly looked at client's scalp, but was unable to visualise
                    25          the haematomas the client had described.  RN encouraged the

                    4          Erin Burin, did you?

                    5      A.  I had two black eyes, a broken nose and a broken lip, bruised
                    6          ribs, bruises all over my body.

                    7      MR. JUSTICE NICOL:  Just a minute.  (Pause) You were being

                    8          particularly asked about bruises and you said you had bruised

                    9          ribs ----

                    10      A.  I had bruised ribs, bruises all over my body, bruises on my
                    11          forearms from trying to defend the blows.  I had two black
                    12          eyes.  I had a broken nose.  I had a broken lip.  I had
                    13          bruises primarily.  The really bad ones were in my hairline,
                    14          in my scalp, my chin ----

                    15      Q.  Just a minute.  (Pause)

                    16      A.  There were chunks of hair missing, there was pus in those
                    17          wounds, in my hairline, dark red bruises specifically, like, </div>

                    20      A.  That is correct.

                    21      Q.  How certain are you about that?

                    22      A.  100%.

                    23      Q.  Now, you had known Ms. Heard for some time by May 2016, had
                    24          you not?

                    25      A.  Since March 2016, I mean 2013.

                    P.1372

                    2      Q.  2013.  They moved in in March 2013, so you had known her three
                    3          years and two months; yes?

                    4      A.  Is that how long that is?

                    5      Q.  13 ----

                    6      A.  From March 2013, from March 2013 is when I first met her, in
                    7          March 2013.

                    8      Q.  I understand.  Have you ever known her to go out to a party
                    9          without makeup on?

                    10      A.  I would not know that.

                    20      MS. WASS:  Yes.  Mr. Baruch, I asked you, having known Ms. Heard
                    21          for three years and a bit, whether you had ever known her go
                    22          to a party or to an outside event without being made up;
                    23          I think you said you could not say that.

                    24      THE WITNESS:  Yes, I would not know that.  I do not know how many
                    25          parties she went to.  I do not know, you know, if every time

                    P.1373

                    2          she went to a party.  So, I could not tell you.

                    But when
                    12          you have known that she has been going to a party, have you
                    13          ever seen her without makeup?

                    14      A.  Any time that I saw her go to an event, that she was decked
                    15          out in, she had makeup on.

                    16      MS. WASS:  Had you ever known her leave the apartment block and go
                    17          to a public place without wearing makeup?

                    18      A.  (Pause) I do not know.  Yes.  Yes.

                    22          made $650 million, and when I fired them for the right
                    23          reasons, I had not only lost the $650 million, but I was
                    24          $100 million in the hole because they had not paid the
                    25          government my taxes for 17 years.

                    Page 716
                    2      Q.  So, as you say, a bad meeting?

                    3      A.  Very unpleasant and ugly, yes.

                    4      Q.  You were asked by Ms. Wass, after the meeting, given how you
                    5          said you were upset, if you had taken cannabis, and you said,
                    6          quite fairly, that you are not sure, but you may have taken
                    7          cannabis, I think you said?

                    8      A.  It is possible that from the meeting which was held at my
                    9          office in the conference room, that on my way down to
                    10          Ms. Heard's dinner, it is possible that I would have smoked
                    11          some cannabis in the car on the way.

                    12      Q.  If you had smoked some cannabis, what effect would it have had
                    13          on you?  Would it have made you angry or in a rage?

                    14      A.  No, it is a calming agent.

                    3          notes.  She explains that on 21st April, "Client invited ----

                    5      MR. SHERBORNE:  No, my Lord, it should be ----

                    6      MR. JUSTICE NICOL:  I beg your pardon.  I have the wrong page.
                    7          Which page?

                    8      MR. SHERBORNE:  K210, my Lord.

                    9      MR. JUSTICE NICOL:  Just a moment.  (Pause) Yes, and the entry for
                    10          21st April 2016?

                    11      MR. SHERBORNE:  My Lord, yes.  Do you have that?  (Pause)

                    12      MR. JUSTICE NICOL:  Mr. Depp, do you have that?

                    13      A.  K210 at the bottom.

                    14      MR. SHERBORNE:  Yes.

                    15      A.  Yes, I do, thank you.

                    16      Q.  So, as you said, Nurse Burin was a friend of Ms. Heard's as
                    17          well as a nurse?

                    Mr. Jenkins,

                    11          have you got file 9 to your left?

                    12      A.  Yes, sir.

                    13      Q.  I am grateful.  Behind tab 91A, if your bundle has been
                    14          updated, do you have there a document entitled "J5.1"?

                    15      A.  Yes.

                    16      MR. JUSTICE NICOL:  Just a minute.

                    17      MR. SHERBORNE:  I am just waiting for his Lordship to find it.

                    18      MR. JUSTICE NICOL:  Sorry, 91A?

                    19      MR. SHERBORNE:  91A.

                    20      MR. JUSTICE NICOL:   Just a moment.  (Pause) Yes, J5.1.

                    21      THE WITNESS:  Yes, I have it.  That is my photo.

                    22      MR. SHERBORNE:  Mr. Jenkins, I was going to ask you if you can
                    23          identify it.  That is your photo, you said?

                    24      A.  That is my photo.

                    25      Q.  We can see at the top that it says 23rd April 2016?

                    P.1338

                    2      A.  Yes.

                    3      Q.  That is the day of Coachella.  Can you identify
                    4          Miss Amber Heard in that photo?

                    5      A.  Right in the middle, wearing the white dress.

                    6      MR. JUSTICE NICOL:  Just a minute.  The dresses are all rather
                    7          coloured, but which is Ms. Heard?

                    8      A.  She is the third one right on the left.

                    9      MR. SHERBORNE:  Right in the middle.

                    10      A.  (Unclear) next to her, the one in the striped shirt, (unclear)
                    11          in the striped shirt, then Ms. Heard, then Rocky, then her
                    12          male friend, then I believe this is her stylist, and her
                    13          sister, Whitney, is at the end.

                    14      MR. JUSTICE NICOL:  So, Ms. Heard is the one in the dress that
                    15          looks slightly green; is that right?

                    21          Amber and the others for the whole time, was he not?

                    22      A.  I do not recall him being around.  I recall him driving us to

                    21          over to you, you got it from room service?

                    22      A.  He is mistaken about who was sick.  I do not recall if he
                    23          actually went to go get those things.  I am not saying that is
                    24          incorrect.  I just do not recall actually receiving those
                    25          things from Starling.

                    11          talking about is Coachella, is it not, and the fact that
                    12          iO Tillet Wright left early?

                    13      A.  I am assuming so, yes.

                    19      Q.  But is what your sister said about the weekend true?

                    20      A.  What about it?

                    21      Q.  From what you witnessed, the bit I read out?

                    22      A.  There is a bunch of information here.  Which are you asking me
                    23          to confirm?

                    Mr Depp�s account of the night of 21 April 2016. Ms Heard partied so hard, she was sick. Mr
                    Starling Jenkins was in attendance as security for Ms Heard. That was his job. He was not
                    going to confuse the subject of his security assignment with someone else.

                    18          you started on Mr. Depp, started complaining about the fact
                    19          that he was late, and you were going on and on at him.  Do you

                    22      Q.  He started to read, you became really annoyed, because one
                    23          thing you get annoyed about is if he does not pay you

                    25      A.  No, ma'am.  He was not reading and I was upset because he had

                    23          I think you said you could not say that.

                    24      THE WITNESS:  Yes, I would not know that.  I do not know how many
                    25          parties she went to.  I do not know, you know, if every time

                    2          she went to a party.  So, I could not tell you.

                    But when
                    12          you have known that she has been going to a party, have you
                    13          ever seen her without makeup?

                    14      A.  Any time that I saw her go to an event, that she was decked
                    15          out in, she had makeup on.

                    16      MS. WASS:  Had you ever known her leave the apartment block and go

                    6      MS. WASS:  Let me ask you a little bit about that.  She was not

                    8      MR. JUSTICE NICOL:  I think you have established that, Ms. Wass.

                    9      MS. WASS:  You did not see her full face on at any time, did you,
                    10          she had her face down and she was upset?

                    11      THE WITNESS:  There were times when she made eye contact.  She was
                    12          visibly upset, so she would look down, and sometimes she would
                    13          look up when she spoke to me.  It was back and forth.  So,
                    14          I did get a look at her entire face.

                    15      Q.  What was the lighting like in this apartment?

                    16      A.  It was very well lit.

                  <div class="timeline-body">DAY 5 (Cross Examination of Trinity Esparza)

                    Ms Esparza was clear that she had not confused Ms Heard with her sister, Whitney Henriques
                    in the week after 21 May 2016. The fact that she had spoken to Ms Heard at close range was
                    confirmed by the CCTV footage subsequently shown to Ms Heard in cross-examination. She
                    had no animosity towards Ms Heard, she liked her; she has no reason to come to court and
                    be untruthful. She was also clear that she knew makeup and Ms Heard well enough to know
                    whether Ms Heard was, or was not, wearing any.

                    Page 876

                    6      Q.  Ms. Heard had a sister called Whitney; do you know that?

                    7      A.  Yes.

                    8      Q.  And Whitney (Hernandez her name is now) actually lived in the
                    9          Eastern Columbia Building earlier in 2015; do you agree?

                    10      A.  Yes.

                    11      Q.  She was a regular visitor even after she moved out of that
                    12          building?

                    13      A.  Yes.

                    14      Q.  And again, you know her by sight?

                    15      A.  Yes.

                    16      Q.  Similar in appearance to Ms. Amber Heard, tall, blonde, slim,
                    17          very attractive?

                    18      A.  Yes.

                    19      MR. JUSTICE NICOL:  Sorry, Ms. Esparza, do you agree that she is
                    20          similar in appearance to Ms. Amber Heard?

                    21      THE WITNESS:  They are tall and blonde, they are sisters, they
                    22          look like ----

                    23      MS. WASS:  They look like sisters, and the description ----

                    24      A.  I suppose so.

                    25      Q.  And the description I have given to you applies to each of

                    Page 877
                    2          them, they are tall, slim, blonde and attractive?

                    3      A.  Yes; but they are quite different people.

                    4      Q.  Now, on 27th May, you saw Ms. Heard at your desk, you were

                  <div class="timeline-body">    21      MR. SHERBORNE:  It was put to you by Ms. Wass that you did not
                    22          really get a proper view of Ms. Heard.  Do you agree that you
                    23          did not get a proper view of Ms. Heard or not, Mr. Bett?

                    24      A.  No, I had a great view of Ms. Heard.

                    25      Q.  How many years did you work in the Sheriff's Department?

                    P.1309

                    2      A.  Approximately 14.

                    3      Q.  During the course of your time at the Sheriff's Department,
                    4          did you have experience of allegations of violence or not?

                    5      A.  Specifically related to calls for service?

                    6      Q.  Yes.

                    7      A.  Oh, indeed I did.

                    8      Q.  You say in your witness statement that Ms. Heard had no red
                    9          marks or evidence of any bruises, abrasions to her face, or
                    10          body.  Having heard Ms. Wass's questions, do you want to
                    11          change that evidence at all?

                    12      A.  Not at all.

                    13      Q.  It was put to you, Mr. Bett -- and I should give you the
                    14          opportunity to comment on it -- that you are lying for
                    15          Mr. Depp.  That is what you have come here to do.  What do you
                    16          have to say about that?

                    17      A.  That is incorrect, sir.

                    18      Q.  Then, finally, you say in your statement, "I could see
                    19          Mr. Depp was visibly upset at having been accused of hitting
                    20          Ms. Heard".

                    21      A.  Correct.

                    22      Q.  Had you seen Mr. Depp be in this state before?

                    23      A.  No.

                    24      A.  Stylist.  She worked with me briefly as a stylist.  She is
                    25          Johnny's lifelong stylist, I believe.

                    P.1731

                    2      MR. JUSTICE NICOL:  Just a moment.  Yes.

                    3      MS. LAWS:  It is inconceivable to suggest that she would not have
                    4          seen you without makeup, but you disagree?

                    5      A.  I disagree.



                    Ms Heard�s conduct after 21 May 2016 when she was seeking to get hold of Mr Depp were
                    inconsistent with the notion that she was �petrified� of him as she declared in order to obtain
                    a Temporary Restraining Order against him.

                    It was also notable in her evidence that she refused to accept what was written in black and
                    white by the attorneys who she had engaged to represent her, whether it was what they said
                    about the alleged abuse or what their demands of Mr Depp entailed in order, they said on her
                    behalf, to resolve the divorce amicably.

                    Further  Ms  Heard�s  account  of  obtaining the  TRO  is  at  odds  with  reality  �  as set  out  in an
                    Annex to the Claimant�s Closing Document


                    DAY 10 (Amber Heard, cross-examination)

                    P.1725

                    5      MS. LAWS:  That would mean that if you had told your lawyer, as
                    6          I suggest you would have done if you are telling the truth,
                    7          what she would have put in this letter is, "He was violent on
                    8          the 21st and he has been violent on so many incidents, a
                    9          number of incidents in the last six months."

                    10      A.  Are you asking me how my lawyer should have written it?

                    11      Q.  If what you are saying is the truth.

                    12      MR. JUSTICE NICOL:  I think what is being put to you, Ms. Heard,
                    13          is that had Mr. Depp been violent to you on more than the
                    14          three occasions that are mentioned in this letter, your lawyer
                    15          would have referred to those. </div>

                    17      A.  No, ma'am.  There was quite a lot going on, aside from the
                    18          fact that I had, I was in very bad financial straits as my
                    19          business managers and lawyers had conspired to steal a lot of
                    20          money.  My mum was in a coma, she then passed away.  Amber and

                    23          Ms. Heard, a friendly relationship.

                    24      Q.  My question was, you have answered it partially, there was an

                    following 21 May 2016. With Mr Baruch, Ms Heard does not, cannot, say that she did not see
                    him up close. Her attempts to say that she was wearing makeup clash with the evidence of a
                    number of others, including Kristina Sexton. Mr Baruch was clearly deeply unsettled by Ms

                  <div class="timeline-body">    13      A.  Absolutely.

                    14      Q.  You said: "I said to my friend something like, 'It looks like
                    15          somebody got hammered, probably these guys had a party'", and
                    16          you were referring to Ms. Heard's friends, Ms. Pennington and
                    17          Mr. Drew; yes?

                    18      A.  Yes.

                    P.1367

                    2      Q.  Now, then your statement carries on: "At that very moment the
                    3          door to penthouse 1 opened and Mr. Drew stepped out far enough
                    4          through the doorway to address me, but also to block my view
                    5          of the apartment inside"; correct?

                    6      A.  He just poked his head out.

                    7      Q.  Okay.

                    8      A.  He opened the door just enough to get his head out.

                    9      Q.  "I asked Mr. Drew what had happened with the spilt wine, and
                    10          he very seriously replied with words to the effect of, 'We
                    11          kind of had a rough day'".  That is correct, is it not?

                    12      A.  Yes.

                    13      Q.  Your statement goes on: "He looked and sounded stressed, and a
                    14          bit worried.  So I asked if he was okay and if he needed help,
                    15          to which he replied, 'No, it's okay, thanks', or words to that
                    16          effect.  I said it was okay, said goodbye, and my friend and
                    17          I went into my apartment."  That is all correct, is it?

                    18      A.  Yes.  Yes.


                    P.1369 (on 22 May 2016)

                    "We" -- that
                    24          is you and Mr. Drew -- "then left my apartment and walked back
                    25          to penthouse 1, where I asked Ms. Heard about Mr. Depp's

                    P.1370

                    2          actions the night before.  She told me that he hit her in the
                    3          face and threw a phone at her.  I then asked her where he had
                    4          hit her.  She stretched her neck and pushed out the right side
                    5          of her head for me to look at her right eye"; yes?

                    6      A.  Yes.  That is correct.  Just like this.

                    7          (Witness demonstrates)

                    19      A.  Yes, and in my conversation with Mr. Depp at the time, he said
                    20          placate her, you know, say what you want to say, calm her

                    12          2nd June 2016?

                    13      A.  Yes.

                    4          Deuters said the texts themselves are suspicious because they
                    5          don't even show a date.  Bottom line, he says he will testify
                    6          under oath he never had a conversation about alleged violence

                    12          conversation with anyone about these texts outside of Johnny's
                    13          then counsel.  I do not recall exactly who it was.  They asked
                    14          me about the texts and I said to them that they were taken out

                    16      Q.  And do you remember there is a part of it in which he makes it
                    17          quite clear that he said, "I did not want you to go to
                    18          Coachella, I left you because you haymakered me, you came
                    19          around the bed to start fucking punching on me" and you did
                    20          not deny it, did you?

                    21      A.  No, that is not what I was having a conversation with him
                    22          about.


                    P.1764

                    4      MS. LAWS:  After the 21st, we are on the 22nd, so the morning you
                    5          saw Rocky, she came into the penthouse; that is right, is it
                    6          not?

                    7      THE WITNESS:  Yes.

                    8      Q.  You, in fact, did not mention or say at all that Mr. Depp had
                    9          hit you or assaulted you in any way, did you?

                    10      A.  That is not true.  I did.

                    11      MR. JUSTICE NICOL:  Just a minute.  (Pause)

                    12      MS. LAWS:  I suggest that is absolutely untrue?

                    13      THE WITNESS:  I texted her that night and said, we had another
                    14          real bad one, which at that point was a well-recognised,
                    15          almost euphemism for a physical altercation.  Rocky knew very
                    16          well I meant that Johnny had hit me.  And I asked her to wake
                    17          me up specifically once she was ready -- well, ready to go in
                    18          the morning, and I managed to get a few hours of sleep.

                    P.1765

                    8      MS. LAWS:  What you said to Rocky is that you had a row.  I will
                    9          repeat the question again.  You at no stage informed Rocky
                    10          that Mr. Depp had hit you or assaulted you?

                    11      A.  Again, I was ----

                    12      MR. JUSTICE NICOL:  Just a minute.

                    13      THE WITNESS:  Sure.  (Pause)

                    25      Q.  And the nurse says this: "I arrived with client's UK

                    Page 718
                    2          assistant", if your Lordship notes that, ".... arrived with
                    3          the client's UK assistant, Savannah, at nine o'clock.  The
                    4          client was socialising with friends" upon Ms. Burin's arrival.
                    5          "She appeared irritable and upset."  She reports being angry
                    6          with husband because he is late and then Nurse Burin provided
                    7          reassurance that he would arrive and encouraged her to
                    8          distract herself by socialising with friends.  Then you will
                    9          see she appears to laugh, but her mood turns to depressed and
                    10          flat when she is alone.  Then she says she cannot believe that
                    11          you are not there yet and so on.
                    12                Then you arrive.  Can you see, "Client's husband, JD,
                    13          arrives at 10.15."  Then it says this.  You appear in good
                    14          spirits, you greet her guests, and during dinner you and
                    15          Ms. Heard sit next to each another.  You appear affectionate
                    16          towards one another and then you socialise with Ms. Burin for
                    17          about 45 minutes.  She says you appear coherent, oriented and
                    18          sociable.  Does that reflect your recollection of how you
                    19          were?

                    20      A.  Yes.

                    17      Q.  Can I take you back to that transcript, which should be in

                    19          did of your meeting on the second day in July 2016 in the
                    20          hotel room in San Francisco.

                    5          give you the reference.  (Pause) I do not know if you have got
                    6          references at the bottom.  Yes, it is F1009 -- do you have
                    7          internal pages at the bottom?

                    14      A.  I do.

                    15      Q.  And do you see, round about the first hole punch, I hope it
                    16          is, that you are saying, "I don't want a divorce"?

                    17      A.  Yes.

                    18      Q.  "I don't want a divorce.  I never wanted a fucking divorce.  I
                    19          never wanted a divorce.  I didn't want you to fucking go to
                    20          Coachella without fucking talking to me because I left you
                    21          because you fucking haymakered me, man.  You came around the
                    22          bed to fucking start punching on me."  Can you explained what
                    23          "haymakered" means, Mr. Depp?

                    21          appear that she was injured or (unclear).

                    22      MR. JUSTICE NICOL:  Sorry, officer, can you repeat your last

                    24      THE WITNESS:  Yes.  Her face was red, it was clear that she was
                    25          crying, but it did not appear redness as if it would have been

                    2          from an injury, from my training and experience.

                    3      MR. JUSTICE NICOL:  Sorry, it did not appear that there was injury
                    4          on her face, is that what you are saying?

                    5      THE WITNESS:  Correct, no injuries.

                    6      MS. WASS:  Let me ask you a little bit about that.  She was not
                    7          making eye contact with you.

                    8      MR. JUSTICE NICOL:  I think you have established that, Ms. Wass.

                    9      MS. WASS:  You did not see her full face on at any time, did you,
                    10          she had her face down and she was upset?

                    11      THE WITNESS:  There were times when she made eye contact.  She was
                    12          visibly upset, so she would look down, and sometimes she would
                    13          look up when she spoke to me.  It was back and forth.  So,
                    14          I did get a look at her entire face.

                    15      Q.  What was the lighting like in this apartment?

                    16      A.  It was very well lit.

                    17      Q.  Did you ask her to go towards a light so you could examine her
                    18          face? </div>

                    7   It is suggested by
                    8          Ms. Wass on a number of occasions that you have lied in your
                    9          witness statement.  In December 2019, which is the date of
                    10          your first witness statement, were you working for Mr. Depp
                    11          still or not?

                    12      A.  What was the year, sorry?

                    13      Q.  December 2019.

                    14      A.  I was not.

                    15      Q.  To be fair to you, I think in your witness statement you say
                    16          you stopped, you parted company with Mr. Depp in August 2016;
                    17          is that correct or not?

                    18      A.  That is correct.

                    19      Q.  In relation to your second witness statement, on 23rd June
                    20          2020, were you working for Mr. Depp, or doing anything for
                    21          Mr. Depp at that time?

                    22      A.  I was not.

                    23      Q.  Mr. Murphy, the final question: did you have to come here to
                    24          give evidence for Mr. Depp and be accused of lying on oath by
                    25          Ms. Wass?

                    P.1207

                    7   It is suggested by
                    8          Ms. Wass on a number of occasions that you have lied in your
                    9          witness statement.  In December 2019, which is the date of
                    10          your first witness statement, were you working for Mr. Depp
                    11          still or not?

                    12      A.  What was the year, sorry?

                    13      Q.  December 2019.

                    14      A.  I was not.

                    15      Q.  To be fair to you, I think in your witness statement you say
                    16          you stopped, you parted company with Mr. Depp in August 2016;
                    17          is that correct or not?

                    18      A.  That is correct.

                    19      Q.  In relation to your second witness statement, on 23rd June
                    20          2020, were you working for Mr. Depp, or doing anything for
                    21          Mr. Depp at that time?

                    22      A.  I was not.

                    23      Q.  Mr. Murphy, the final question: did you have to come here to
                    24          give evidence for Mr. Depp and be accused of lying on oath by
                    25          Ms. Wass?

                    P.1207

                    2      A.  I definitely did not have to come here.
